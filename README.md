# Parsing ATRIAS logfiles
This repository is a variety of scripts to interpret data from ATRIAS logfiles.
The core interpreter is logfileToStruct.m, which formats and interprets the raw
logfiles.  A simple template to start from is robotStateFilterTest.m, which
shows how to load, shorten, and use data.
